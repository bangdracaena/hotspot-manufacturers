Osprey Electronics 5G Hotspot G1

SenseCAP M3 is a Helium 5G gateway. It works with Small Cell to provide users with LTE or 5G coverage. It integrates a WM1302 LoRaWAN module and a dedicated TPM2.0 module, which enable the gateway to do PoC activities and mine IOT and MOBILE tokens at the same time.

* What are your plans for software setup and configuration for the devices?

SenseCAP MX Team has developed the SenseCAP Hotspot App which was launched in April 2022. It could operate as the software setup and configuration app. It also includes remote updates and the ability for hosts to change wifi settings.

* Which security implementation (ECC608, TPM, TrustZone, other) are you using? 

TPM2.0

* Which LoRa chipset are you planning to use in your gateway? (We recommend you don't use the SX1301 in new designs.) 

SX1302/1303 + SX1250

* What is the CPU? 

Intel® Celeron® J4125, Quad-Core 2.0-2.7GHz
